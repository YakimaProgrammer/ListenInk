I have a PDF document with complex layouts that I need to transcribe accurately. The document may contain text in multiple columns, headers and footers, captions for images, tables, and various other elements. I want the transcription to be readable and meaningful for an audio read-aloud, which means:
1. Column Order: If the text is in multiple columns, read it top-to-bottom within each column, then move to the next column in a left-to-right order.
2. Headers and Footers: Ignore superfluous headers, footers, and page numbers.
3. Captions and Images: Transcribe captions and place them logically in the transcription, ideally following the content they describe. Skip purely decorative images, but preserve images that contain critical content.
4. Tables and Structured Data: Capture tables in a readable format. Read table headers first, followed by each row in sequence.
5. Font Variations: Identify section headers or emphasized text (like bold or italicized phrases) to clarify important points, but avoid unnecessary styling details.
6. Line Breaks and Formatting: Where line breaks are not meaningful (like in prose), remove them to allow natural reading flow. Retain line breaks in poetry or bulleted lists.
7. Logical Flow: Preserve the logical order of content to ensure it reads as naturally as possible.

Please provide a transcription based on these criteria. Please output only the transcript and nothing else.
